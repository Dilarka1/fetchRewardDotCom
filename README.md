Game
Given a balance scale and 9 gold bars of the same size and look. You don’t know the exact weight of each bar, but you know they are the same weight, except for only one fake bar. It weighs ​less​ than others. You need to find the fake gold bar by only bars and balance scales.
You can only place gold bars on scale plates (bowls) and find which scale weighs more or less.

Challenge
1. Play around with the website and find the ​best​ algorithm (minimum number of weighings for any possible fake bar position) to find the fake gold bar.
2. Create the selenium based project using any preferable language to perform
a. clicks on buttons (“Weigh”, “Reset”)
b. Getting the measure results (field between “bowls”)
c. filling out the bowls grids with bar numbers (0 to 8)
d. getting list of weighings
e. Clicking on gold bar number at the bottom of the website and checking alert message
3. Code the algorithm from the step 1 which is using set of actions from step 2 to finds the fake gold bar
The algorithm should populate and weigh gold bars until a fake one is found, click on a fake bar number, output the alert message, number of weighing and list of weighing were made.
